/**
 * This class abstracts the reading from a stream of data (i.e. a string). The objective of
 *   using this class is to enable the creation of other classes (e.g. FileStreamReader) to
 *   read from other char streams (e.g. a file)
 * 
 * The class gets a string that will be used as the buffer to read, and then it is possible
 *   to sequentially get the characters from the string using funcion *nextchar*, that will
 *   return "false" when the stream is finished.
 * 
 * Other functions to change the position are also available (e.g. goto)
